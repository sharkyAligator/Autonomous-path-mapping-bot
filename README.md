# Pixelate '22 

Simulated an autonomous robot on PyBullet that used live video feed from an overhead camera,to apply image
processing to navigate itself through a pattern maze.
Used OpenCV for image processing on the images from the live video feed of the overhead camera.
Implemented the Dijkstra algorithm to move the robot in the arena in a given pattern.
